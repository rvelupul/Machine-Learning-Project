Data analysis and visualization project

This is a data analysis and visualization project which uses various libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn and tkinter. This project is useful for analyzing important data and visualizing it using graphs. Data analytics is crucial for obtaining accurate data for smarter business decision making and to optimize their performances. This project can be used for reviewing key performance metrics, interpreting data and using it to determine an effective strategy for a better performance. 

To get started on the project, you will be prompted to create a user account. Once you do so, you can sign in with the username and password you created. This is when you can import a dataset that has been downloaded to your computer. A few datasets have been given already for your convenience.
